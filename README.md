## !! ATTENTION !!
_**Whilst this is a booting and "mostly" working EFI for this machine, do bear in mind that everyone has different hardware peripherals that they use, but for the most part, this should get it booted for you. There always could be more fine tuning done as well. This is meant to get you going in general. NOTE: For anything beyond Big Sur 11.3.x, one will need to map their USB ports and have a port mapped kext in place before updating to anything 11.3.x or later, as XHCIPortLimit patch no longer works beyond those versions. Take this as a reminder that nothing can replace a properly mapped set of USB ports at the ACPICA level.**_
